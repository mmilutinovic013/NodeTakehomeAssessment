# Node Takehome Assessment

Node.js is becoming a widely adopted platform for developing web applications. This project provides an environment evaluate a Node.js application an its source code for OWASP Top 10 security risks. The task at hand is to analyze this vulnerable application for as many vulnerabilities as possible within a 48 hour period. You will then have 24 hours to write a report addressing these vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for how to fix the underlying source code to fix them. These recommendations will be presented to a technical interview panel for assessment.

## Getting Started
OWASP Top 10 for Node.js web applications:

##### Default user accounts
The database comes pre-populated with these user accounts created as part of the seed data -
* Admin Account - u:admin p:Admin_123
* User Accounts (u:user1 p:User1_123), (u:user2 p:User2_123)
* New users can also be added using the sign-up page.

## How to Set Up Your Copy of the Node Takehome Assessment

### OPTION 1 - Run Node Takehome Assessment on Docker

The repo includes the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml necessary to set up the app and db instance, then connect them together.

1) Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) and [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) 

2) Clone the github repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mmilutinovic013/NodeTakehomeAssessment.git
   ```

3) Go to the directory:
   ```
   cd NodeTakehomeAssessment
   ```

4) Build the images:
   ```
   docker-compose build
   ```

5) Run the app, this starts the Node Takehome Assessment application at http://localhost:4000/:
   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```

### OPTION 2 - Run Node Takehome Assessment on your machine

1) Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) - Node Takehome Assessment requires Node v8 or above

2) Clone the github repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mmilutinovic013/NodeTakehomeAssessment.git
   ```

3) Go to the directory:
   ```
   cd NodeTakehomeAssessment
   ```

4) Install node packages:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

5) Set up MongoDB. You can either install MongoDB locally or create a remote instance:

   * Using local MongoDB:
     1) Install [MongoDB Community Server](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)
     2) Start [mongod](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod)

   * Using remote MongoDB instance:
     1) [Deploy a MongoDB Atlas free tier cluster](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/deploy-free-tier-cluster/) (M0 Sandbox)
     2) [Enable network access](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/security/add-ip-address-to-list/) to the cluster from your current IP address
     3) [Add a database user](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/create-mongodb-user-for-cluster/) to the cluster
     4) Set the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable to the connection string of your cluster, which can be viewed in the cluster's
        [connect dialog](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/connect-to-your-cluster/#connect-to-your-atlas-cluster). Select "Connect your application",
        set the driver to "Node.js" and the version to "2.2.12 or later". This will give a connection string in the form:
        ```
        mongodb://<username>:<password>@<cluster>/<dbname>?ssl=true&replicaSet=<rsname>&authSource=admin&retryWrites=true&w=majority
        ```
        The `<username>` and `<password>` fields need filling in with the details of the database user added earlier. The `<dbname>` field sets the name of the
        database nodegoat will use in the cluster (eg "nodegoat"). The other fields will already be filled in with the correct details for your cluster.

6) Populate MongoDB with the seed data required for the app:
   ```
   npm run db:seed
   ```
   By default this will use the "development" configuration, but the desired config can be passed as an argument if required.

7) Start the server. You can run the server using node or nodemon:
   * Start the server with node. This starts the Node Takehome Assessment application at [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/):
     ```
     npm start
     ```
   * Start the server with nodemon, which will automatically restart the application when you make any changes. This starts the Node Takehome Assessment application at [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/):
     ```
     npm run dev
     ```

#### Customizing the Default Application Configuration
By default the application will be hosted on port 4000 and will connect to a MongoDB instance at localhost:27017. To change this set the environment variables `PORT` and `MONGODB_URI`.

Other settings can be changed by updating the [config file](https://github.com/mmilutinovic013/NodeTakehomeAssessment/blob/master/config/env/all.js).

### OPTION 3 - Deploy to Heroku

This option uses a free ($0/month) Heroku node server.

Though not essential, it is recommended that you fork this repository and deploy the forked repo.
This will allow you to fix vulnerabilities in your own forked version, then deploy and test it on Heroku.

1) Set up a publicly accessible MongoDB instance:
   1) [Deploy a MongoDB Atlas free tier cluster](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/deploy-free-tier-cluster/) (M0 Sandbox)
   2) [Enable network access](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/security/ip-access-list/#add-ip-access-list-entries) to the cluster from anywhere (CIDR range 0.0.0.0/0)
   3) [Add a database user](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/create-mongodb-user-for-cluster/) to the cluster

2) Deploy Node Takehome Assessment to Heroku by clicking the button below:

   [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

   In the Create New App dialog, set the `MONGODB_URI` config var to the connection string of your MongoDB Atlas cluster.
   This can be viewed in the cluster's [connect dialog](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/connect-to-your-cluster/#connect-to-your-atlas-cluster).
   Select "Connect your application", set the driver to "Node.js" and the version to "2.2.12 or later".
   This will give a connection string in the form:
   ```
   mongodb://<username>:<password>@<cluster>/<dbname>?ssl=true&replicaSet=<rsname>&authSource=admin&retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```
   The `<username>` and `<password>` fields need filling in with the details of the database user added earlier. The `<dbname>` field sets the name of the
   database nodegoat will use in the cluster (eg "nodegoat"). The other fields will already be filled in with the correct details for your cluster.
